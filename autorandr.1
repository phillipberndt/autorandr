.TH AUTORANDR 1
.SH NAME
autorandr \- automatically select a display configuration based on connected devices
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B autorandr
[\fIOPTION\fR] [\fIPROFILE\fR] 
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program automatically detects connected display hardware and then loads an appropriate X11 setup using xrandr. It also supports the use of display profiles for different hardware setups.
.PP
Autorandr also includes several virtual configurations including \fBoff\fR, \fBcommon\fR, \fBclone-largest\fR, \fBhorizontal\fR, and \fBvertical\fR. See the documentation for explanation of each.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help
\fRDisplay help text and exit
.TP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-change
\fRAutomatically load the first detected profile
.TP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-default \fIPROFILE
\fRMake profile \fIPROFILE\fR the default profile. The default profile is used if no suitable profile can be identified. Else, the current configuration is kept.
.TP
\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-load \fIPROFILE
\fRLoad profile \fIPROFILE
.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-save \fIPROFILE
\fRSave the current setup to profile \fIPROFILE
.TP
\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-\-remove \fIPROFILE
\fRRemove profile \fIPROFILE
.TP
.BR \-\-batch
\fRRun autorandr for all users with active X11 sessions
.TP
.BR \-\-current
List only the current (active) configuration(s)
.TP
.BR \-\-config
Dump the variable values of your current xrandr setup
.TP
.BR \-\-cycle
Cycle through all detected profiles
.TP
.BR \-\-debug
Enable verbose output
.TP
.BR \-\-detected
List only the detected (i.e. available) configuration(s)
.TP
.BR \-\-dry\-run
Don't change anything, only print the xrandr commands
.TP
.BR \-\-fingerprint
Fingerprint the current hardware setup
.TP
.BR \-\-match-edid
Match displays based on edid instead of name
.TP
.BR \-\-ignore-lid
By default, closed lids are considered as disconnected if other outputs are detected. This flag disables this behaviour.
.TP
.BR \-\-force
Force loading or reloading of a profile
.TP
.BR \-\-list
List all profiles
.TP
\fB\-\-skip\-options [\fIOPTION\fR] ...
\fRSet a comma\-separated list of xrandr arguments to skip both in change detection and profile application. See \fBxrandr(1)\fR for xrandr arguments.
.TP
.BR \-\-version
Show version information and exit
.SH FILES
Configuration files are searched for in the \fIautorandr
\fRdirectory in the colon separated list of paths in \fI$XDG_CONFIG_DIRS
\fR- or in \fI/etc/xdg
\fRif that var is not set.  They are then looked for in \fI~/.autorandr
\fRand if that doesn't exist, in \fI$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/autorandr
\fRor in \fI~/.config/autorandr\fR if that var is unset.

In each of those directories it looks for directories with \fIconfig\fR and
\fIsetup\fR in them.  It is best to manage these files with the
\fBautorandr\fR utility.

.SH DEFAULT OPTIONS

You can store default values for any option in an INI-file located at
\fI~/.config/autorandr/settings.ini\fR. In a config section, you may
place any default values in the form \fIoption-name=option-argument\fR.

.SH HOOK SCRIPTS

Four more scripts can be placed in the configuration directory:
.TP
\fIpostswitch\fR
Executed after a mode switch has taken place. This can be used to notify
window managers or other applications about the switch.
.TP
\fIpreswitch\fR
Executed before a mode switch takes place.
.TP
\fIpostsave\fR
Executed after a profile was stored or altered.
.TP
\fIpredetect\fR
Executed before autorandr attempts to run xrandr.

.PP
These scripts must be executable and can be placed directly in the
configuration directory, where they will always be executed, or in
the profile subdirectories, where they will only be executed on changes
regarding that specific profile.

Instead (or in addition) to these scripts, you can also place as many
executable files as you like in subdirectories called script_name.d
(e.g. postswitch.d).
.PP

Some of autorandr's state is exposed as environment variables prefixed with
\fIAUTORANDR_\fR, such as:
\fIAUTORANDR_CURRENT_PROFILE\fR,
\fIAUTORANDR_CURRENT_PROFILES\fR,
\fIAUTORANDR_PROFILE_FOLDER\fR,
and \fIAUTORANDR_MONITORS\fR
with the intention that they can be used within the hook scripts.

The one kink is that during \fIpreswitch\fR, \fIAUTORANDR_CURRENT_PROFILE\fR
is reporting the upcoming profile rather
than the current one.
